# Calculate Area and Perimeter of a Circle
Write a program in Java that calculates the area and perimeter of a circle whose radius you get from the user.  
Write a program that finds the area of a slice of circle with radius r and measure 𝛼 of the central angle.
```java
Area Formula: π * r * r;

Circumference Formula: 2 * π * r;

Take 𝜋 = 3.14.

Formula : (𝜋 * (r*r) * 𝛼) / 360
```
