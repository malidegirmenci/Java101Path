# Pattern
Write a "Recursive" method in Java language without looping which obeys the following rule based on the n value received from the user.  
**Rule**   
Subtract 5 from the entered number up to where the entered number is 0 or negative. Print the last value to the screen during each subtraction. Add 5 again after the number is negative or 0. Again, print the last value of the number on the screen in each addition operation.
